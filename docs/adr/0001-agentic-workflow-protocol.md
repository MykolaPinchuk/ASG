# ADR 0001 — Agentic workflow protocol

## Context
This repo is intended to be developed by multiple generations of coding agents under human supervision.
Continuity depends on durable repo artifacts rather than chat history.

## Decision
We standardize on:
- `agents.md` as the general instruction entrypoint (generated by `context-manager-1`).
- `repo_workflow.md` as the repo-specific workflow contract (triggers + procedures).
- `onboarding.md` + `HANDOFF.md` + `REPO_MAP.md` as the minimal repo-local onboarding set.
- `agent_logs/current.md` for in-progress logging, rotated at handoff.
- Version branches `v0`, then `v1`, `v2`, ... (human pushes).
- Strict git hygiene: never commit secrets or bulky artifacts.

## Consequences
- Agents must keep `HANDOFF.md` accurate to avoid chat-history dependence.
- Repo evolution is handled via `REPO_MAP.md` updates at handoff when entrypoints/structure change.
- Agents may commit locally (checkpoint/handoff), but must never push.

## Alternatives considered
- Relying on chat history alone (rejected: fragile across agent changes).
