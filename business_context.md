This repo builds a small, deterministic, replayable turn-based strategy game designed as an evaluation environment for LLM agents.

Key constraints:
- Deterministic, seed-replayable match outcomes.
- Human watchability via replay + viewer and concise rationale traces.
- Engine rules are defined normatively in `docs/planning/MVP_SPEC.md`.
