- always save replays
- always have latency calculated and returned properly
- for v0 or v05, never use more than 30 plies and more than 5 games per model/bot type
- unless specifically mentioned, do not use Random bot.
- for OSS sweeps, prefer `--timeout-ms 40000` (40s) per agent decision unless you explicitly want longer
- explicit overrides (when you really mean it): `--unsafe-allow-long true`, `--unsafe-allow-many true`
