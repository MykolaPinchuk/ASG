# REPO_MAP

Keep this file short. Update it only when something important changes.

## Critical entrypoints (read these first for work)
- `agents.md` — general instructions (generated by `context-manager-1`).
- `repo_workflow.md` — repo-specific workflow (triggers + procedures).
- `onboarding.md` — onboarding procedure when triggered.
- `HANDOFF.md` — current objective, next steps, and state.
- `REPO_MAP.md` — index of important files and hot paths.
- `README.md` — repo overview and agent start points.
- `agent_logs/current.md` — live execution log for this cycle.
- `docs/planning/MVP_SPEC.md` — normative MVP rules/spec (source of truth).
- `docs/planning/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` — milestone plan.
- `docs/planning/ROADMAP.md` — post-MVP direction.
- `scenarios/scenario_01.json` — initial scenario data.
- `schemas/replay.schema.json` — replay JSON schema.
- `schemas/agent_api.schema.json` — agent API schema (post-MVP v0).

## Where results live (ignored by default)
- `agent_logs/` — per-cycle logs and index.
- `replays/` — replay outputs (ignored; keep examples small if ever committed).
- `runs/` — per-run outputs (ignored).

## Utility scripts
- `scripts/sanitize_runs_markdown.py` — replace embedded images in `runs/**/{summary,report}.md` with links.

## Local-only directories (ignored)
- `secrets/` — local credentials (see `secrets/README.md`).

## Hot paths (last 1–2 cycles)
- (path) — (why it's being touched)

## New important files since last cycle
- (path) — (purpose)
