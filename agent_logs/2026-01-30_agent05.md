## Agent
- id: agent05

## Timestamp (Pacific)
- start: 2026-01-28

## Intent
- Repair repo workflow state and codify local guardrails (replays/latency, plies/games caps, avoid RandomBot by default).

## Notes
- Do not commit secrets or bulky artifacts (see `.gitignore`).

## Log

- 2026-01-28 17:30:28 PST — Repaired workflow drift from agent04 cycle: added `extra_instructions_v0.md` as a tracked guardrails doc (and referenced it from `repo_workflow.md`/`REPO_MAP.md`), updated README to avoid RandomBot defaults, and enforced v0/v05 policy caps in CLIs (`turnCapPlies<=30`, `games/count<=5` unless `--unsafe-allow-long/--unsafe-allow-many`).
- 2026-01-28 17:43:45 PST — OSS perf snapshot vs MixBot (seed=3, `turnCapPlies=30`, `timeout-ms=60000`, 1 game/model, early stop after 1 provider error): replays under `replays/oss_vs_mix_30ply_60s_1g_2026-01-28T17-40-47PST/`, summaries under `runs/model_sweeps/oss_vs_mix_30ply_60s_1g_2026-01-28T17-40-47PST/` (`chutes.json`, `nanogpt.json`).
- 2026-01-28 18:10:00 PST — Chutes sweep vs MixBot (excluded prior baselines; 10 models; seed=3; `turnCapPlies=30`; `timeout-ms=40000`; early stop after 1 provider error): replays under `replays/chutes_vs_mix_30ply_40s_1g_2026-01-28T17-57-33PST/`, results under `runs/model_sweeps/chutes_vs_mix_30ply_40s_1g_2026-01-28T17-57-33PST/` (`chutes/results.json`).
- 2026-01-28 18:25:00 PST — Chutes “reasoning-only” sweep vs MixBot (seed=3; `turnCapPlies=30`; `timeout-ms=40000`; early stop after 1 provider error; set `reasoning-effort=low` only for known timeout models): replays under `replays/chutes_reasoning_vs_mix_30ply_40s_1g_2026-01-28T18-23-38PST/`, results under `runs/model_sweeps/chutes_reasoning_vs_mix_30ply_40s_1g_2026-01-28T18-23-38PST/chutes/results.json`.
- 2026-01-28 18:39:00 PST — Chutes baselines vs MixBot at 40s (seed=3; 1 game/model): `tngtech/DeepSeek-R1T-Chimera`, `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3-0324-TEE`, `chutesai/Mistral-Small-3.1-24B-Instruct-2503` all drew at 30 plies with 0 provider errors. Replays/results: `replays/chutes_baselines_vs_mix_30ply_40s_1g_2026-01-28T18-31-00PST/`, `runs/model_sweeps/chutes_baselines_vs_mix_30ply_40s_1g_2026-01-28T18-31-00PST/results.json`.
- 2026-01-29 — Policy + runner default changes:
  - Baseline upstream timeout increased to 70s while still advertising a 40s response SLA in the prompt (commit `d4f9bbe`).
  - Added/updated focus shortlist and reporting artifacts (see `runs/reports/*`), later consolidated to `docs/focus20_models.md`.
- 2026-01-29 — OSS-120B experiments on Chutes:
  - `openai/gpt-oss-120b-TEE` with `--reasoning-effort low` won vs Mix with much lower latency vs baseline.
  - `openai/gpt-oss-20b` on Chutes was workable but slow and had intermittent provider-error turns.
- 2026-01-30 — Cerebras provider setup + probes:
  - Added Cerebras provider defaults/entrypoints and committed a safe checkpoint (commit `5defea9`).
  - Discovered Cerebras rejects `include_reasoning` entirely (even when `false`); updated `openai_compat` to omit it for provider `cerebras`.
  - `zai-glm-4.7` on Cerebras emits output in `message.reasoning` and can omit `message.content` (potentially problematic for strict JSON parsing).
- 2026-01-30 — Cerebras `gpt-oss-120b` vs MixBot:
  - With a “safe” config (`--reasoning-effort high --max-tokens 8000 --stream off --tools-mode off --use-tools false`) it won quickly vs MixBot (seed=3), but still had a single provider-error turn.
