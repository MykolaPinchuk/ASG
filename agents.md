# Global Instructions (Baseline)

- Do not go outside this repo. Do not delete or edit any files outside this workspace!!!
- Even if you have mistakenly or unintentionally created a file or a folder outside this repo, do not edit or delete it w/o asking permission. In such cases stop your work and ask human for a permission to delete them.
- Use rapid iteration. Start with a simple version that works, then add features incrementally. When dealing with large tasks, proceed in small increments and validate key assumptions/results for each increment before proceeding further. Validate assumptions quickly. Then add complexity incrementally.
- Do not run any code which is expected to take more than 5 minutes to run. Use timeouts. Use 2 minutes as default timeout for any code execution. When producing final results, we may need to run code for much longer. It this is necessary, communicate this to human and get approval first.
- Run code to verify behavior. Do not rely on assumptions or placeholders.
- When in doubt, err on the side of not overengineering.
- Never replace user-provided values with placeholders.
- When code fails repeatedly, capture detailed step-by-step logs and investigate.
- You can use all except one vCPUs/threads available at this machine.
- When discussing with human plan and the next steps, be honest and critical. Human usually lacks very deep understanding of low-level details of what we are about to build, and has a limited ability to grasp future consequences of the decisions we are about to make. Feel free to push back and provide better suggestions. If human asks to do something which does not seem to make sense, stop and explain to human why this is a bad idea before proceeding.
- When onboarding on a repo, it may be useful to run very small and very fast smoke test with the main logic. This can help understand how code works.
- Human has a poor attention span. He often tells agent to do something ill-thought and unwise. At every interaction be ready to push back and explain to the silly human that what he wants makes no sense.
- Use Pacific time for timestamps.

# Codex Workflow (Repo-local)

Some repos define **repo-local** agent workflow rules (triggers + procedures) in `repo_workflow.md`.

If `repo_workflow.md` exists:
- Treat it as the source of truth for repo-specific process (onboarding, logging conventions, handoff procedure).
- Follow its triggers:
  - `Onboard`
  - `handoff` / `wrap up`

If a repo uses `context-manager-1` to generate `agents.md`:
- The general multi-repo guidance lives in `agents.md`.
- Repo-local workflow lives in `repo_workflow.md`.

Notes:
- Repo-local workflow may permit git actions (e.g., checkpoint/handoff commits). If it does, follow it for that repo.

# Repo-specific agent notes (ASG)

## Version branching model
- Branches are version-aligned: `v0` (MVP), then `v1`, `v2`, ...
- Only the human pushes; agents may create local commits when asked (`checkpoint` / `handoff`) or after coherent milestones.
- Never start work on `vN+1` without explicit human approval.

## Commit message format
- All agent-made commits MUST include the agent id prefix (from `agent_logs/current.md`):
  - `agentNN: checkpoint(<area>): <summary>`
  - `agentNN: handoff(<area>): <summary>`
- Areas: `workflow`, `docs`, `engine`, `runner`, `viewer`, `schemas`, `misc`.

## Artifacts hygiene (non-negotiable)
- Never commit secrets/credentials (see `.gitignore` and `secrets/`).
- Default: do not commit generated artifacts (`runs/`, `replays/`, build outputs).

## Time limits
- Default to short commands with timeouts; avoid long-running jobs unless explicitly requested.
